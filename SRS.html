        <h2 style="color:#00C569;">1. Introduction</h2>
        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p>“Find a store” system is a platform between small local businesses and at home customers to connect and interact with each other. In 
        a way the system is an attempt to virtualize the typical interactions between the two party. The inspiration for this project is to 
        reduce the necessity of going outside for day-to-day household products during the pandemic.
        <h4 id="sec1.2">1.2 Document Convention</h4>
        <p>The document is written following the IEEE template for SRS (Software
          Requirement Specification). The headers, sub-headers, paragraphs are written as follows: <br><br>
          i. Headers: Calibri Head, font size-16, Bold <br>
          ii. Sub-headers: Calibri Head, font size-14 <br>
          iii. Paragraphs: Calibri Body, font size-12 <br><br>
          Bold text is used to put emphasis, phrases/words that are defined in the glossary
          are given in italic with their serial numbers as superscript and a table is used in Section-4
          to list the actions and system responses under extended use cases of each feature and on
          Section 2.3 to show user classes and their pertinent characteristics.</p>
        <p> The primary intended audience of this SRS document are the project team
          members and our course instructor. It should also be understandable to knowledgable
          technical person such as software developers and software industry business
          specialists. </p>
        <h4 id="sec1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h4>
        <p>The main product of our system are the two separate Android app for customers 2 &amp;
          shop-owners 3 . Interaction between the two parties will be done using the two apps. The
          system also consists of a website that enables customers 2 to view and post reviews and
          shop-owners 3 to view their transactions analytics. The goals and objectives of the system
          are stated below,</p> 
          <p>Goals (what we hope to achieve):</p>
          <ul>
          	<li> Substitute/reduce the need for going outside to get day-to-day household items from
          local stores; particularly- stationary stores, bakeries, convenience stores. </li>
          	<li> Virtualize the existing interaction between the two party. </li>
          	<li> Ensure desirable user experience and user expected reliability. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Objectives (how we hope to achieve the goals):</p>
          <ul>
          	<li> Mimic the well-known traditional behaviors between customers 2 and shop-owners 3
          through the android app and website wherever possible. </li> 
          	<li> Include features that are easy to use and understand such as- connect customers &amp;
          shop-owners through voice call, form a queue when multiple customers at a shop, take
          available items input by scanning barcodes etc. (Broadly discussed in section-4) </li>
          	<li> Design UI components following the designs of existing popular app and websites.</li> 
	  </ul>

        <h2 style="color:#00C569;">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p> 
        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
        <p>The idea of this system is inspired from the current area-wise lockdown enforced all
          over Bangladesh as a counter measure to the pandemic. By using our android app
          customers from home can connect with local shops to get day-to-day necessary items,
          while small businesses struggling dearly due to lock-down can continue business. A
          simple diagram of the overview of the whole system is given below,</p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h4>
        <p>The major features of the system are as follows,
        <ul>
          <li> Register shop-owner accounts &amp; customer accounts. </li>
          <li> Customers can find shops nearby from map or search for shops by items. </li>
          <li> Shop-owners entry items by scanning product barcode or image to text conversion
          from product sticker. </li>
          <li> Customers enter shops wait in queue(if any), browse items &amp; chat with other
          customers while waiting.</li>
          <li> Orders are placed and finalized over voice call (app-to-app) between customers &amp;
          shop-owners.</li>
          <li> System suggestion of efficient delivery sequence.</li>
          <li> Shop-owners and customers view reviews given by customers.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p>Two type of users will interact with our system’s app and website- customer, shop-owner. On the basis of their characteristics 
        further divisions can be made,</p>
          <p><u>Based on technical expertise</u>: </p>
        <p><table style="width:100%">
          <tr align="center">
            <th>User class</th>
            <th>Characteristic</th>

          <tr>
            <td>Technophobes (majority)</td>
            <td>Unwilling to use technology
              such as mobile phones,
              computers.</td>
            <td>Housewife (customer),
              domestic workers (customer),
              old person etc.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Technology Shy</td>
            <td>Moderate technical expertise.
              Responsive to clear-cut,
              visible benefits.</td>
            <td>People who use phones and
              computers where absolutely
              necessary.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tech-savvy</td>
            <td>Comfortable with latest
              technologies. Well-aware of
              new trends.</td>
            <td>Mostly young generation of

              people.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        
        <p><u>Based on Shop type</u>: </p>
          Initially app consists of three shop types- convenience stores, stationary stores and bakeries. Accordingly the shop-owner account 
          types can be though of these three types as well.
        </p>

        
        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Operating Environments</h4>
        <p><u>Android App</u>:</p>  
        <ol>
          <li>Device Hardware – 
          	<ul>
          	<li> “Android compatible” device.[1] </li>
          	</ul>
          
          <li> Operating System – Android 5.1 (Lolipop) or above. </li>
          <li> Software Component – Google Play Services, Sinch Android SDK. </li>
        </ol>
          <p><u>Website</u>: Any browser that runs html, css and javascript.</p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
        <p><ul>
        	<li> Shop-owner account’s legitimacy is a concern, since anyone can register.
          Although we have phone number verification at sign-up implemented. </li>
          	<li> Reliability of delivery and receiving is completely up to the users. The app is
          merely a medium for confirmation. </li>
          	<li> The basic (free) version API/SDKs, database, hosting service that are used
          allow a threshold amount of usage. It is important to note that their
          functionalities are essential for the system. </li>
          	<li> Since the Android OS is open-source, it’s implementation differs from
          manufacturer to manufacturer. Certain features of our app may not function
          smoothly due to restrictions put in the OS implementation. </li>
          	<li> The App requires user permission for working with components like- fetching
          location, microphone-speaker access, camera access etc.</li>
          	<li> The core features require continuous active internet connection. </li>
          	<li> Majority of the target users for the system are technophobe, technology-shy
          people. Acceptability of the designed UI/UX is uncertain.</li>
        
        </ul></p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h4>
        <p>A demo video of the app and website usage will be available to the users. No
          documented manual is to be provided.</p>
        
        
        <h4 id="sec2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
        <p>Assumptions: <br>
        <ul>
          	<li> Users will adhere to their consents made using the app. Such as- shop-
          	owners will deliver and customers will pay on delivery according to their
          	mutual consent, customers and shop-owner provide their actual home/store
          	address etc. </li>
		<li> Customers &amp; shop-owners phones have working microphone, speaker 
		and/or headphone/earphone connectibility. </li>
		<li> Shop-owners and staff account (if allowed) holders to have a working 
		camera on phone that is compatible for working with scanning and text detection tools used. </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Dependencies:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Users need to have google play services installed on their android phones
        	(which is pretty common). Particularly- Barcode Scanning &amp; TextRecognition from ML kit, Maps SDK, Fused Location API.</li>
        </ul>

 <h2 style="color:#00C569;">3. External Interface</h2>
        <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>The UI of the app is designed in such a way that any user can interact with the application comfortably. When the user launches the app for the first time, the landing page welcomes the user with "Sign Up (Get Started)" or "Sign In" option.
        </p><br>
        <img style="border: 4px;" height = "450" width="300" src="image/SVG/getStarted.svg" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>The "Sign In" option will land the user to the "Login" page where existing users can use their credentials (e.g., email and password) to log in</p>
        <img height = "450" width="300" src="image/SVG/Screen – Login.svg" alt="">
	
        <p>For the new user, the "Sign Up" option will take them to a page where they have to enter their phone number for verification. The OTP code will be needed to insert on the next page to continue the verification process</p>
        <img height = "450" width="300" src="image/SVG/Screen – Verification.svg" alt=""> 
        <img height = "450" width="300" src="image/SVG/Vcode.svg" alt=""> <br>

        <p>After the successful mobile number verification, the user must have to set their profile by providing necessary information in the "Setup Profile" page.</p>
        <img height = "450" width="300" src="image/SVG/2 Sign Up.svg" alt=""><br><br>

        <h4 id="sec5.1">5.1 Performance Requirements</h4>
        <p>There are no specific performance requirements for this application. But, the real-time systems for messaging, VoIP service, and client-shop owner cart systems should be designed in such a way that there is no significant time delay in the application. The responsive UI has to perform precisely to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>

        <p>There are no specific performance requirements for this application. But, the real-time systems for messaging, VoIP service, and client-shop owner cart systems should be designed in such a way that there is no significant time delay in the application. The responsive UI has to perform precisely to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>
        <h4 id="sec5.3">5.3 Security Requirements</h4>
        <p>The users must have to verify their identity and provide authentic information for creating an application account. Each user must have their own user account to use the application. All kinds of user data will be kept safe, and the system will not enclose any user information without user concern. That will ensure data privacy. Moreover, the authentic users only system will provide security among the users of the application</p>

        <h4 id="sec5.4">5.4 Software Quality Attributes</h4>
        <p>The requirements in this section specify the required reliability, availability, and maintainability of the software system.

        <h4 id="sec5.5">5.5 Business Rules</h4>
        <p>The users will be provided with the freemium version of the application by default. The free version may contain ads. The users can upgrade their accounts, which will grant the premium version of the application with some extra services and free of ads. The migration to the premium version will be a onetime purchase for all the users. </p>

        <h2 style="color:#00C569;" id="section6">6. Other Requirements</h2>
        <p> One extra requirement of this project is to be inline with the latest technology trends and make sure it is a software worthy of the 
        next era. We have taken global research and advisory firm - Gartner’s predictions as guideline to achieve this.</p>
        <h4> The Project in light of Gartner Top Technology Trends </h4>
        <p>According to Gartner the leading technologies in the software industries for this era are- AI, AR, block-chain, intelligent search 
        features. Their most recent prediction consists of 10 technology trends for the year 2020 [2], which include- hyper-automation, multi-
        experience, human augmentation, distributed cloud, AI security etc. The “find a store” system somewhat adheres to a few of these 
        predictions in its features. Such as- </p>
        
        <ol>
        	<li><u>Multi-experience</u>: Replacing necessity of technology-literate people with people-literate technology. “Find a store” 
        	isn’t the traditional online shop app/website. The platform lets customers and shop-owners connect and interact with each other, 
        	with special focus to small local businesses. The system attempts to virtualize these interactions that make local small 
        	businesses stand out. </li><br>
        	
        	<li><u>AI</u>:  The system uses google play services ML kit provided SDKs- barcode scanning and text recognition to ease the 
        	product list input process for the shops.</li><br>
        	
        	<li><u>Distributed Cloud</u>:  The main database for the system is the Google’s Cloud Firestore which is a serverless distributed 
        	cloud service. Distributed cloud platforms make product scale up process much easier and cost saving.</li><br>
        </ol>
