        <h2 style="color:#00C569;">1. Introduction</h2>
        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p>“Find a store” system is a platform between small local businesses and at home customers to connect and interact with each other. In a way the system is an attempt to virtualize the typical interactions between the two party. The inspiration for this project is to reduce the necessity of going outside for day-to-day household products during the pandemic. 
        <h4 id="sec1.2">1.2 Document Convention</h4>
        <p>The document is written following the IEEE template for SRS (Software
          Requirement Specification). The headers, sub-headers, paragraphs are written as follows: <br><br>
          i. Headers: Calibri Head, font size-16, Bold <br>
          ii. Sub-headers: Calibri Head, font size-14 <br>
          iii. Paragraphs: Calibri Body, font size-12 <br><br>
          Bold text is used to put emphasis, phrases/words that are defined in the glossary are given in italic with their serial numbers as superscript and a table is used in Section-4 to list the actions and system responses and on Section 2.3 to show user classes and their pertinent characteristics. </p>
        <h4 id="sec1.3">1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
        <p> The primary intended audience of this SRS document are the project team
          members and our course instructor. It should also be understandable to knowledgable
          technical person such as software developers and software industry business
          specialists. </p>
        <h4 id="sec1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h4>
        <p>The main product of our system are the two separate Android app for customers 2 &amp;
          shop-owners 3 . Interaction between the two parties will be done using the two apps. The
          system also consists of a website that enables customers 2 to view and post reviews and
          shop-owners 3 to view their transactions analytics. The goals and objectives of the system
          are stated below,</p> 
          <p>Goals (what we hope to achieve):</p>
          <ul>
          	<li> Substitute/reduce the need for going outside to get day-to-day household items from
          local stores; particularly- stationary stores, bakeries, convenience stores. </li>
          	<li> Virtualize the existing interaction between the two party. </li>
          	<li> Ensure desirable user experience and user expected reliability. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Objectives (how we hope to achieve the goals):</p>
          <ul>
          	<li> Mimic the well-known traditional behaviors between customers 2 and shop-owners 3
          through the android app and website wherever possible. </li> 
          	<li> Include features that are easy to use and understand such as- connect customers &amp;
          shop-owners through voice call, form a queue when multiple customers at a shop, take
          available items input by scanning barcodes etc. (Broadly discussed in section-4) </li>
          	<li> Design UI components following the designs of existing popular app and websites.</li> 
	  </ul>

        <h2 style="color:#00C569;">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p> 
        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
        <p>The idea of this system is inspired from the current area-wise lockdown enforced all
          over Bangladesh as a counter measure to the pandemic. By using our android app
          customers from home can connect with local shops to get day-to-day necessary items,
          while small businesses struggling dearly due to lock-down can continue business. A
          simple diagram of the overview of the whole system is given below,</p>
        <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h4>
        <p>The major features of the system are as follows,
        <ul>
          <li> Register shop-owner accounts &amp; customer accounts. </li>
          <li> Customers can find shops nearby from map or search for shops by items. </li>
          <li> Shop-owners entry items by scanning product barcode or image to text conversion
          from product sticker. </li>
          <li> Customers enter shops wait in queue(if any), browse items &amp; chat with other
          customers while waiting.</li>
          <li> Orders are placed and finalized over voice call (app-to-app) between customers &amp;
          shop-owners.</li>
          <li> System suggestion of efficient delivery sequence.</li>
          <li> Shop-owners and customers view reviews given by customers.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p>Two type of users will interact with our system’s app and website- customer, shop-owner. On the basis of their characteristics further divisions can be made, <br>
          Based on technical expertise: <br> </p>
        <p><table style="width:100%">
          <tr>
            <th>User class</th>
            <th>Characteristic</th> 
            <th>Example</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Technophobes (majority)</td>
            <td>Unwilling to use technology
              such as mobile phones,
              computers.</td>
            <td>Housewife (customer),
              domestic workers (customer),
              old person etc.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Technology Shy</td>
            <td>Moderate technical expertise.
              Responsive to clear-cut,
              visible benefits.</td>
            <td>People who use phones and
              computers where absolutely
              necessary.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tech-savvy</td>
            <td>Comfortable with latest
              technologies. Well-aware of
              new trends.</td>
            <td>Mostly young generation of

              people.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        
        <p>Based on Shop type: <br>
          Initially app consists of three shop types- convenience stores, stationary stores and bakeries. Accordingly the shop-owner account types can be though of these three types as well.
        </p>

        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Operating Environments</h4>
        <p><u>Android App</u>:</p>  
        <ol>
          <li>Device Hardware – 
          	<ul>
          	<li> “Android compatible” device.[1] ref: https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/compatibility#defined </li>
          	<li>Screen width 4’’ – 6’’, typical phone screen. </li>
          	</ul>
          
          <li> Operating System – Android 5.1 (Lolipop) or above. </li>
          <li> Software Component – Google Play Services, Sinch Android SDK. </li>
        </ol>
          <p><u>Website</u>: Any browser that runs html, css and javascript.</p>
        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
        <ul>
        	<li> Shop-owner account’s legitimacy is a concern, since anyone can register.
          Although we have phone number verification at sign-up implemented. </li>
          	<li> Reliability of delivery and receiving is completely up to the users. The app is
          merely a medium for confirmation. </li>
          	<li> The basic (free) version API/SDKs, database, hosting service that are used
          allow a threshold amount of usage. It is important to note that their
          functionalities are essential for the system. </li>
          	<li> Since the Android OS is open-source, it’s implementation differs from
          manufacturer to manufacturer. Certain features of our app may not function
          smoothly due to restrictions put in the OS implementation. </li>
          	<li> The App requires user permission for working with components like- fetching
          location, microphone-speaker access, camera access etc.</li>
          	<li> The core features require continuous active internet connection. </li>
          	<li> Majority of the target users for the system are technophobe, technology-shy
          people. Acceptability of the designed UI/UX is uncertain.</li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <h4 id="sec2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h4>
        <p>A demo video of the app and website usage will be available to the users. No
          documented manual is to be provided.</p>
        <h4 id="sec2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
        <p>Assumptions: <br>
        <ul>
          	<li> Users will adhere to their consents made using the app. Such as- shop-
          	owners will deliver and customers will pay on delivery according to their
          	mutual consent, customers and shop-owner provide their actual home/store
          	address etc. </li>
		<li> Customers &amp; shop-owners phones have working microphone, speaker
and/or headphone/earphone connectibility. </li>
		<li> Shop-owners and staff account (if allowed) holders to have a working
camera on
phone that is compatible for working with scanning and text detection tools
used. </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Dependencies:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Users need to have google play services installed on their android phones
        	(which is pretty common). Particularly- Barcode Scanning &amp; TextRecognition from ML kit, Maps SDK, Fused Location API.</li>
        </ul>

 <h2 style="color:#00C569;">3. External Interface</h2>
        <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>The UI of the app is designed in such a way that any user can interact with the application comfortably. When the user launches the app for the first time, the landing page welcomes the user with "Sign Up (Get Started)" or "Sign In" option.
        </p><br>
        <img style="border: 4px;" src="image/1.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>The "Sign In" option will land the user to the "Login" page where existing users can use their credentials (e.g., email and password) to log in</p>
        <img src="image/2.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>For the new user, the "Sign Up" option will take them to a page where they have to enter their phone number for verification. The OTP code will be needed to insert on the next page to continue the verification process</p>
        <img src="image/3.jpg" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>After the successful mobile number verification, the user must have to set their profile by providing necessary information in the "Setup Profile" page.</p>
        <img src="image/4.jpg" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>After completing the authentication process, the user will land on the map-view page locating all the nearby stores, which is also considered as the homepage of the application. Every store on the map has a status indicator (dot) where red, yellow, and green represent not available, busy, and available status.</p>
        <img src="image/5.jpg" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>To access a store, the user has to tap on the store icon or the name. This will take the user to the specific store page where the user can see the existing queue and a button/option to enter the shop.</p>
        <img src="image/6.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>After entering the shop, the user can see his/her name on the queue and access the "Chat" window from the tab above the page. In the chat window, the user can chat with the existing customers in the queue</p>
        <img src="image/7.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>On the browse tab, the user can see the existing products and their prices that are available in the store.</p>
        <img src="image/8.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>There is an option besides the search box on the navigation bar in the map-view page which allows users to access the menu. The “Menu” page contains several functionality which enables the user to edit profile, view pending orders, check order history and change application settings.</p>
        <img src="image/9.JPG" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>
          On the shop-owner version, the user(owner) will be landed on their shop's specific customer queue page after the authentication process. In the queue tab, the user can see the list of all the customers waiting for the service
          </p>
          <img src="image/10.JPG" alt=""> <br> <br>

          <p>The "Next Customer" option at the bottom of the homepage takes the user (owner) to the "Purchase List" page. On that page, the user can add the items that the client agrees to buy. There are options for confirming the current order and controlling the ongoing phone call in the bottom section.</p>
          <img src="image/11.JPG" alt=""> <br> <br>
          <p>On the browse tab (from homepage), there is a list of items that are currently available at the store.The shop-owner can add new items, modify the prices, and remove out of stock items from the list.</p>
          <img src="image/12.JPG" alt="">
    

        <h4 id="sec3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
        <p>The device that will run the application, requires WIFI and GPS for using the map and detecting the accurate user location. The device also needs the camera for barcode and product scanning and speaker and microphone for voice call.</p>

        <h4 id="sec3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
        <p>The minimum android operating system version required to run the application is "Lolipop5.1 (API level 22)".  The application will work properly on any device with the latest (from android 5.1 to 10) android operating system.</p>

        <h4 id="sec3.4">Communications Interfaces</h4>
        <p>Real-time voice protocol (RTP) is used in this application for VoIP service, which allows the users to make calls using internet connections. For chatting or messaging, Firebase Cloud Message (FCM) is used, which ensures data protection (GDPR) and encryption.</p>
