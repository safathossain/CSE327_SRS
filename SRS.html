        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p>Purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to describe the specification and description of our project ''House Rental Management System''. This Software Requirements Specification illustrates, in clear terms, the system's primary uses and required functionality so that the next developers can easily understand what we did and how to change anything if it is required.
        <h4 id="sec1.2">1.2 Document Convention</h4>
        <p> Main Titles: Font: Calibri, Face: Bold, Size: 18 
        <p> Sub Section Titles: Font: Calibri, Face: Bold, Size: 14
        <p> Other Explanations: Font: Calibri, Face: Normal, Size: 12
        <h4 id="sec1.3">1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h4>
        <p> This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is designed for Software Designer, Software Developers, Software Tester and for Project Manager. Suggestion for everyone is to read the SRS sequentially from first page to last page.
        <h4 id="sec1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h4>
        <p> House Rental Management System is a platform where a person can easily find a suitable house within his requirements (Price, Number of bedrooms, Number of Toilets, Common Space etc.). When a tenant fills up his requirements through app, the app will show some suggest house which can be suitable for him. He can also message the owner for confirmation. After that the tenant can pay all the bills including house rent from this platform including Bkash / Rocket. The tenant can also complain about anything about his apartment through this app. The tenant has to upload all his information and document through this app before 1 month of rent a house.
An owner of a house can upload his requirements to rent his house. He can upload his appointment picture and upload it through app. He can show all the information of the tenant and he cam show all the transection history of payment.

        <!-- Descriptions edited -->

        <h2 style="color:#411f1f;">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p> This section deals with a broad overview of the product Koto � Finance Manager, explaining the functionalities and goals that the software aims to achieve. It also provides details on the dependencies, constraints, operating environment of the product along with user classes and user manuals.
        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 Product Perspective</h4>
        <p> This rental management system apps will build a communication with landlord. By through this apps tanent can pay there house-rant to the landlord. This is the main perspective of our product.
        <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 Product Functions</h4>
        <p> The product functions are heavily user dependent (as elaborated in System Features section). The admin�s function is to only maintain the software and update it whenever necessary. In order to make the functions comprehensible, a use case diagram of the user.</p>
         </p>
        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p> There are three types of users of the platform. The admin,tanent and the landlord.

The tanent and the landlord will be able to use the mobile app and the web app. They can use all the features the mobile app provides.

The administrator will take product data from the tanent and will apporave them on the portal.

        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Operating Environments</h4>
        <p> The operating environment is given below:
        <!-- For listing the attributes -->
        <ul> <li> Distributed Database </li>
             <li> Operating System: any system that supports a modern web browser</li>
             <li> Database Configuration: Flask and Google Firebase </li>
             <li> Platform: Web and Android </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
        <p> As this an online application, internet connection is a constraint. Internet connection is crucial for the application to fetch data from the database over the internet.
Both the web portal and the mobile application will be constrained by the capacity of the database. Since the database is shared between both application it may be forced to queue incoming requests and therefor increase the time it takes to fetch data,
Android version is a mobile software constraint as the SDK used requires android version.
        <h4 id="sec2.6">2.6 User Documentation</h4>
        <p> The product will provide users with in-app slideshow instructions to run the users through the basics and a short video tutorial demonstrating the final software product.
        <h4 id="sec2.7">2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h4>
        <p>One assumption for the android application is the application will be used mostly on high-end or latest phones as for a few years as the hardware requirement can only be met on those phones.
Another assumption is phones with good camera will be providing the best performance as plane detection depends on the picture quality of the camera.
Proper browser should be used for the web app and a stable internet connection is required.</p>

 <h2 style="color:#5FD3BC;">3. External Interface</h2>
        <h4 id="sec3.1">3.1 User Interfaces</h4>
        <p>When the user uses the service for the first time, they will be prompted the registration page. Already registered users can select to login through a button which will bring them to a log-in page. Name, Password, Address, Phone Number will be collected from the registration page. Users should be able to login by using their email and password.
User can omit the login process on the web version of the system, they will be opted to login in future if they make a purchase.
If the user is already logged into the system, they will land on the home page. The home page will show the most recent uploaded products to the tanent and landlord. Tanent will be able to search the products based on title or category tags of the products.
Every user will have a profile page from where they can view/edit their user information. They can also delete their account from this page.
When a tanent clicks on a product it will bring them to that specific product detail page. This page will contain name, retailer and description of the product. If the tenant is on the mobile app, they can also view the product via AR. This functionality will not be implemented in the web version. But on the mobile app a camera interface will open.

        <h4 id="sec3.2">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h4>
        <p>Neither the mobile application nor the web version has any special hardware requirements. So, the system will not have any hardware interface.  The camera required for AR experience is assumed to be provided by the mobile phones where the app will be installed.

        <h4 id="sec3.3">3.3 Software Interfaces</h4>
        <p>Both the mobile application and the website will communicate with the database via internet. The operating system will provide such interfaces. Both the platforms will consist of operations regarding read and write of data.

        <h4 id="sec3.4">Communications Interfaces</h4>
        <p>The means of communication between the different part of the system is not important and will be handled by the operations provided by the browser or operating system.
        <br><br><br>
